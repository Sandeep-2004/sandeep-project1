   <p> Hello! This is a generator for text fonts of the "cool" variety. I noticed people were trying to find a generator like fancy letters, but were ending up on actual font sites rather than generators of copy-paste text like this one. So currently this is basically a duplicate of the above, but I think I'll try to collect a few more "cool" text fonts, like the old enlgish one, and specialise this a bit.
If you're wondering how one produces cool text fonts like you see above, it's fairly simple (but maybe not what you'd expect). Basically, the text that gets generated isn't actually a font - it's a bunch of symbols that are in the unicode standard. You're reading symbols that are in the unicode standard right now - the alphabet is a part of it, as are all the regular symbols on your keyboard: !@#$%^&*() etc.
So the difference is, these rad "fonts" that are produces, just don't happen to appear on your keyboard - there's not enough room. The unicode standard has more than 100,000 symbols defined in it. That's a lot of symbols. And amongst those symbols are many different "alphabets" - some of which this translator is able to produce.
Incidentally, the fact that they're not actually fonts means that you can copy them to places like instagram, facebook, twitter, tumblr, etc. If they were just fonts, you wouldn't be able to copy and paste the text - it'd just show up ad plain text when you pasted it.
If there's a super cool "font" within the unicode that you know of, and that isn't currently included in this converter, please let me know! It's really easy to add a new alphabet, so just copy the character and paste them in the comments area and I should see it. Thanks! Hope that you have fun with these different writing fonts :)
